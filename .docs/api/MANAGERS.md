# Managers

Managers are responsible for the CRUD operations of Symphony objects such as `Author`, `Entry`,
`Field`, `Section`, `Page`, `DataSources` and `Events`.
Some managers only use the database as their storage while others use the disk.
Hence, there are data managers (database) and resources managers (disk).
