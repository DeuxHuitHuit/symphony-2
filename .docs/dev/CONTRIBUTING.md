Symphony uses [npm](https://npmjs.com/) to build concatenated and minified assets,
so make sure you have node and npm installed and in your path.

1. Install all dependencies from the repositoryâ€™s root:

		npm install

2. Build the assets

		npm run build

3. Run the test suite

		npm test

4. Optionally, you can minify script and style files upon saving source files

		npm run watch
